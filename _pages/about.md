Hi!
I am testing out the commit here. and once again

Thank you for visiting my homepage. 
It is still in very early stage of development, and I will update it in the coming months. 

The goal of this website is to bring some details of my research closer to the public. 
There are many portals for popular science briefs of the contemporary cutting-edge science, but I wish to contribute by sharing a more personal view.

You can find these updates in the "Blog" section, which I will periodically update with small summaries of recent achievements.

I am thankfull to the people who made this GitHub template that I am adapting.
You can find their template at (https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
